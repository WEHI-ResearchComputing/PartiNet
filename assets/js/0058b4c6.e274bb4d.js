We\'ll process cryo-EM micrographs from start to finish.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation":{"id":"installation","title":"Installation","description":"PartiNet can be installed using several methods. Choose the option that best fits your environment and requirements.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"PartiNet is a powerful command-line tool for particle picking on cryo-EM micrographs. It provides a comprehensive three-stage pipeline designed to clean, identify, and prepare particles from experimental data for subsequent processing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"stages/denoise":{"id":"stages/denoise","title":"1. Denoise","description":"Denoising can vastly improve particle picking by helping to increase signal to noise in low-dose micrographs. Different denoising algorithms exist, include deep denoisers Topaz (Bepler et al., 2020) and Janni (Wagner and Raunser., 2020) and various Gaussian and fourier space denoisers. PartiNet implements a modified heuristic Wiener filter denoiser based on the method from CryoSegNet (Gyawali et al., 2024). PartiNet\'s implementation introduces multiprocessing, allowing for high-throughput denoising of large datasets, as well as saving in .mrc format if you prefer to perform picking on denoised micrographs in RELION or CryoSPARC.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"stages/detect":{"id":"stages/detect","title":"2. Detect","description":"PartiNet uses a modified version of an adaptive YOLO architecture called DynamicDet (Lin et al., 2023) to identify particles in cryo-EM micrographs. This stage provides highly accurate particle detection with customizable confidence and overlap thresholds.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"stages/star":{"id":"stages/star","title":"3. STAR","description":"The partinet star command is the final step in your particle picking pipeline. It converts the particle coordinates detected in the previous stage into a standardized STAR file format that can be used with downstream cryo-EM processing software like RELION, cryoSPARC, or other reconstruction programs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"training/split":{"id":"training/split","title":"1. Split Training Data","description":"The split command organizes your annotated particle data into training and validation sets, preparing it for PartiNet model training. This step can either convert STAR files from manual picking sessions directly to YOLO format, or split existing YOLO labels into organized train/val directories.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"training/train1":{"id":"training/train1","title":"2. Train Dual Detectors","description":"PartiNet\'s architecture requires a two-step training regime. The first step is to train PartiNet\'s dual detectors to identify particles in a micrograph.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"training/train2":{"id":"training/train2","title":"3. Train Adaptive Router","description":"PartiNet\'s architecture requires a two-step training regime. This step assumes you have already trained PartiNet to identify particles. Next you will train PartiNet\'s adaptive router to discriminate between hard and easy micrographs for real-time routing during detection. This step is almost identical to the previous training step, except that your model weight MUST be a .pt file from step 1.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"training/training-output":{"id":"training/training-output","title":"Training Output Reference","description":"This page describes the output generated during PartiNet training (both Step 1 and Step 2).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
